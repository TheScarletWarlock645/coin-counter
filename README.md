## What Is Coin Counter?
Coin Counter is a Flutter/Dart based applicatio built for parents and children in order to track allowance given to kids. Alloting money for chores and jobs can get complicated and overwhelming quickly. Coin Counter aims to solve this issue by streamlining the process in a simple and open-source package.

Coin Counter allows for the creation of parent accounts and child accounts. These accounts are then seperated into households that can be easily managed by parents. Parents can easily make chore lists and alot a certain amounts of coins to different tasks. When a child completes a task, they can take a photo of the completed chore and send it through the app to the parent. At which point the parent can accept it or deny it. If the completion is denied, then coins for the chore are not given. If it is accepted, then the previously alloted coins transfer to the childs account.

**Note:** Coins in coin counter are not a real currency of any kind, and are simply a means of tracking said money in the real world.
